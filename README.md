# Wgpu Tutorial

Wgpu tutorials based on [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/).

## Tutorials

I've tried to follow the order of the original tutorials as best as possible.
The following sections serve as a contents page of sorts.
To run a specific example, type:

```
cargo run --bin EXAMPLE_NAME
```

The corresponding name is shown next to the example in the below list.
For example, to run the _Hello triangle_ example, type:

```
cargo run --bin hello-triangle
```

### Getting started

- [Hello triangle](tutorials/getting-started/hello-triangle.md) (`hello-triangle`)

## Acknowledgements

It would be rude to not acknowledge, up front, the key resources that I have used to learn WGPU and graphics programming.

- [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/).
Thank you Joey de Vries for the awesome work you've done explaining GPU graphics programming and the OpenGL API.
- [Learn Wgpu](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/).
Thank you Benjamin Hansen for the amazing kickstart your knowledge of wgpu has given me.
