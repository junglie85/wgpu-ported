# More cubes

Based on the More cubes section of [https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Coordinate-Systems](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Coordinate-Systems).

Instead of using multiple draw commands to render multiple instances of the same model with a different transform it would be better to use instancing.
Instancing is covered in a future sample.
