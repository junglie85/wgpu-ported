# More cubes

Based on the More cubes section of [https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Coordinate-Systems](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Coordinate-Systems).

In the original tutorial a uniform buffer is used to pass the model data for each object to the shader.
We do the same here although it should be noted that this requires a buffer for each object rather than reusing the existing buffer.
